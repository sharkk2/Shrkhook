**Troll RAT disguised as a QR code generator**

Needs an XOR encrypted token "or just a normal token" for the discord bot.
Build the code into an exe and once the exe is executed the bot that's token is inside the config should start and the computer with the exe will be controlled from that bot.
Packages & hidden imports (for pyinstaller) are found using the scanner.py "which shouldn't be packaged into the exe"
